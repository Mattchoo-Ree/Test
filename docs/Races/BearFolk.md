# Bearfolk


![[alena-kubikova-polar-bearfolk-ranger-final2-1000px-cz.jpg|left|210]] Bearfolk are massive people of iron resolve and deep nobility, resembling bears that walk upright rather than all fours. Hailing from either the cold climates of Northern [[Council of Mythrenhil|Mythrenhil]] or from a nation made of [[The Outcasted The Lasmuig Dynasty|The Outcasted]], bearfolk put their trust in family and tribe to stand against the world. In defiance of their brutish appearance, they are deeply spiritual and artistic. Their keen senses and physical prowess make them formidable enemies, but their practical nature and protectrive instincts make them fantastic allies. Bearfolk rarley leave their tribes without good reason. Those who do often find themselves pulled into excitement and adventure.

## Tribe and Family

The core of bearfolk society is the immediate family. Parents care for their cubs until the young reach the age of 5 or 6 years, when a precocious shift takes over. Although they aren’t yet fully grown, the cubs are drawn by a powerful urge to explore. They begin spending time away from their family, treating their entire village (or smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement) as a sort of extended family. This can be surprising or even annoying for nonbearfolk neighbors, who might discover a bearfolk child rooting through their pantry for a snack, inviting itself to dinner, or even adopting them as its new family temporarily. This isn’t necessarily as inconvenient as it sounds, since young bearfolk are also more enthusiastic learners and harder workers around the house than most other children their age.

Beyond immediate family, the tribe forms the majority of bearfolk culture. Once bearfolk cubs start venturing beyond their own homes, families intertwine. Each cares for the cubs that happen by that day, welcoming the wayward children to meal tables as their own. There’s no choice but to know one’s neighbors in a bearfolk tribe, and that brings them all closer together. Trade apprenticeships and budding talents are identified early thanks to this intermingling, and it helps find a suitable niche for a young bearfolk’s path in life.

Elders are highly respected for their experience and greater perspective, but practicality carries weight as well. Being old doesn’t afford one unlimited leeway if one makes questionable decisions or has a reputation for foolishness. Building on this respect, bearfolk venerate their ancestors at a nearly demigod level and believe the spirits of their ancestors guide them. The tribe also holds druids and clerics (particularly those that serve nature deities) in high respect and looks to them for guidance.
## Forgotten Ancestry
![[1uyt39i9m7b61.webp|right|300]]
The true origin of bearfolk is unknown, but many scholars suspect they are the descendants of werebears that took to living in the wilderness. Over time, their lycanthropy became permanent and integral, giving them the best features of human and ursine biology, along with some weaknesses. The best evidence for this is their aversion to silver, which true lycanthropes are known to share. It is not uncommon for bearfolk to take in and mentor those who have been newly cursed with lycanthropy, teaching them how to live with their animal characteristics. It is not possible for bearfolk to pass on their ancestral curse, but the question of whether they can be infected with any new form of lycanthropy is unknown. What is certain is that their origins are not mundane, even though their connection to the natural world is strong.

## Passion and Wrath

Their intimidating mien is no veneer. Bearfolk have a deep and impressive capacity for violence when roused to anger or in defense of their own. Bearfolk passions run as strong as their bodies, and banter that pushes the boundary into insults and bruised honor often leads to more bruises. Their great physical strength means they excel at battle, and even relatively minor physical altercations can inadvertently become serious. Many bearfolk wear scars from physical contests, both simple competition and more serious matters of wounded honor, that went a little too far.

Thanks to their physical prowess, many bearfolk follow the path of the warrior. Barbarians and fighters are common, with rangers and druids following closely.

When bearfolk go to war, they do so with the clear goal of protecting their people in the moment and in the future. If that means the destruction of a foe, then so be it. They are adept at weaving their talents together in the same manner they blend families into tribes. Spellcasters favor turning the natural world against their foes with conjured beasts and manipulating battlefield conditions through weather, controlling plants, and even shaping the earth itself.

## Bearfolk Names

Bearfolk are given cub names by their parents, similar to names found throughout the Northlands. When a bearfolk comes of age, they earn a new name, either bestowed upon them by an elder or one they choose themselves. This name befits a deed undertaken during their rite of passage into adulthood, describes some honorable or prominent trait of the bearfolk in question, or honors an ancestor.

Your bearfolk character has the following racial traits.

_**Creature Type.**_ You are a Humanoid.

_**Size.**_ You are Medium.

_**Speed.**_ Your walking speed is 30 feet. You have either a swimming speed or a climbing speed equal to your walking speed (choose when you select this race).

_**Bear Claws.**_ You have claws which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

_**Born Survivor.**_ You are proficient in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, or Survival.

_**Keen Smell.**_ You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival), and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that involve smell.

_**Ursine Fortitude.**_ You have resistance to cold damage. At the end of a short or long rest, you can expend and roll one Hit Die to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). While you have these hit points, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

_**Aversion to Silver.**_ The cuts of silver blades cause searing pain. Attacks made against you with silvered weapons ignore the AC bonus of Ursine Fortitude. You cannot reduce any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage dealt to you by silvered weapons.
