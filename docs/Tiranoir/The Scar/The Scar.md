# The Scar
The site of the battle between the Gods after the [[Great Collapse]]



![[Cathair Caillte]]

The barren lands, where magic itself is broken thanks to the great battles once fought here. The creatures have changed and morphed, some through natural evolution and some from the strange magic that permiates the land air and water of the sky. The land is scatered with the ruin's of the ancient civilization the [[Daoine Tíre]]


# Traversing the Scar
At the start of each day, choose a player to roll 1d20 on th encounters table. 
Roll 1d6 to determine the magical interference for the day

## Magical Interference
The magic in this area causes spellcasting to become potentialy dangerous. Roll a d6 at the begining of everyday, on a 1-3 the area only has light magical interference, while on a 4-6 the area has high magical interference.

### Light magical Interference
When a spell of 2nd level or higher or a spell slot of 2nd level or higher is expended for any reason. Roll a d20, on a 15 or above roll on the Unraveling table. Other than that the area is fairly normal. 

If in the underdark roll a d6 again, on a 1-3 the area is dimly lit thanks to mushrooms and lichen otherwise it is darkness.

### High magical interference
Areas with high magical interference have the following effects

- Areas are always filled with dim light.

-   A creature in an area suffused with faerzress has advantage on saving throws against any divination spells. If a divination spell doesn’t allow a saving throw, the caster must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to cast the spell. Failing this save means the spell is wasted and has no effect.

-   Any creature attempting to teleport into, within, or out of a the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 force damage and the teleportation attempt fails. Even if the save succeeds, the teleportation attempt can suffer a mishap as if the destination was known only by description, regardless of how familiar the destination actually is. See the table in the [teleport](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleport) spell for more information.

-   Areas like this have such unstable magic it is activley dangerous to use magic. When a spell of 1st level or higher is cast here, Roll 1d6, On a 1-3 Roll on the unraveling Magic Effects.

### Unraveling Magic Effects
| d20 | Effect |
| --- | ------ |
| 1   |  All magic items in the region temporarily lose their magical properties, becoming nonmagical for 1 hour. Artifacts are unaffected. When the items regain their magic, a creature’s attunement to any of them is restored.      |
| 2   | The region becomes a dead-magic zone for 1 hour. For the duration, the entire region is affected by the [antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field) spell.       |
| 3   | One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed in [Otiluke’s resilient sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/otilukes-resilient-sphere) for 1 minute.       |
| 4   |  One random creature in the region that has expended spell slots regains one expended spell slot of a random level.      |

| 6   |   One of the characters in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a [blink dog](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16809-blink-dog), as if by the [polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph) spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until dispelled.     |
| 7   |  One random creature in the region that has spell slots expends one spell slot of a random level in a harmless shower of sparks and sounds.      |
| 8   |   All fire in the region freezes into ice that gives off a blue light equal to the illumination it normally provides. In addition, the region radiates [extreme cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold "Extreme Cold") (see the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_) for 1 day.     |
| 9   |   One random creature in the region with spell slots becomes a focal point for ambient magic for 1 hour. At the end of each of the creature’s turns, other creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against the spellcaster’s spell save DC or take 1d6 force damage.     |
| 10  |   The [flaming sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flaming-sphere) spell (save DC 15) spontaneously activates in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the party. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the sphere moves 30 feet toward the nearest creature. The sphere vanishes after 1 minute.     |
| 11  |    Simple or martial weapons in the region that are nonmagical crackle with power. For 1 hour, they become magic weapons that grant a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them.    |
| 12  |     Swirling energy surrounds one random creature in the region for 24 hours. For the duration, the creature gains resistance to force damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.   |

| 14  |    One random creature in the region crackles with sparks of light for 1 hour. For the duration, the creature magically sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, any creature it touches (requiring an unarmed strike if the target is unwilling) takes 1d6 force damage.    |
| 15  |  Lightning arcs in a 5-foot wide line between two creatures in the region that are within 30 feet of each other and not behind total cover.

| 17  |  On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), two random creatures in the region must each make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the creatures magically teleport, switching places. If both saves succeed, they don’t teleport.  Catoblepas or Aeorian Reserver    |
| 18  |One random creature in the region breaks spells for 1 hour. Whenever anyone within 20 feet of the creature casts a spell, the spellcaster must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using its spellcasting ability, or the spell drains away without effect. The spell slot, charge, or feature use that powered the spell is wasted.        |
| 19  |  During the next 24 hours, the first time a creature in the region targets another creature with a spell, the caster must make a DC 11 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, the spell targets the caster instead. On a successful save, the spell functions normally. This effect then ends.      |
| 20  | One random creature in the region can suddenly cast the [wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish) spell once, within the next minute. Reroll if you’ve rolled this effect in the past 24 hours.       |

#### **Crystal Clusters**
The adventurers pass through a High Magic interference area containing fist-sized chunks of quartz that shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. A sharp blow to one of the crystals, including throwing it so it impacts a hard surface, causes it to burst in a 10-foot-radius flash of blinding light. Any creature within the radius must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) for 1 minute. A creature [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) by this effect repeats the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded).

#### **Gas Leak**
The adventurers come upon a cavern with a dangerous natural gas leak. Any member of the party with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 14 or higher detects signs of the gas. The characters’ travel pace for the day is slowed by half as they circumvent the area, but there are no ill effects. If the gas goes undetected, each character in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any open flames brought into the area cause the gas to explode. Each creature in the explosion must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Collision

This terrain encounter occurs only if one or more party members are traveling by raft or boat, and there’s a strong current. Have the ship DC 13 Dexterity check to avoid hitting a wall or other large obstacle directly ahead. If the group check succeeds, the collision is avoided. Otherwise, the vessel takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage from the collision, and everyone aboard must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling overboard.

#### Rockfall
Loose rocks fall from the ceiling above. 1d10 character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, Disadvantage without light or be hit by a chunk of falling stone for 4d6 bludgeoning damage. All successful saves result in the boat takeing the damage instead, aswell as taking 1d10 extra boulders worth. Charecters can choose to try and catch or be hit by them to stop the boat from takeing damage. 
#### Rough Current
The waters here are especially turbulent. The boat must make a DC 15 Navigators Check. If the boat fails DC 10 Strength or Dex save to not fall overboard and the boat taked 4d6 bludgeoning damage
#### Stone Teeth
This terrain encounter occurs only if one or more party members are traveling by raft or boat, and there’s a strong current. Stalagmites jutting up from the bottom of a tunnel are hidden just below the waterline. Spotters must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check to notice the “stone teeth,” allowing the vessel’s crew to attempt a DC 17 Navigaters check to navigate through them. If the check succeeds, the vessel passes through with only half damage. Failure to notice or navigate through the stone teeth deals 6d6 piercing damage to the boat or raft.
#### Whirlpool
An underwater crevasse or drain creates a small vortex in this area, When the boat enters this area, it must make a DC 17 Navigators Check to get around it
#### Horrid Sounds
For hours, the party’s travel is plagued by terrible shrieks, moans, and incoherent gibbering echoing through nearby passages, without any apparent origin. Each character must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character’s madness level increases by 1.
#### Lava Swell
As the party traverses a long and winding corridor, a tremor opens up a lava-filled fissure behind them. Each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the lava swell, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save. The vessel must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid this damage
#### Ruins
#### Steam Vent
A hot steam vent erupts beneath a random party member, who must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.
#### Webs
Sticky webs fills a passage (see “[Dungeon Hazards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#DungeonHazards)” in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). The webs extend for hundreds of feet. Unless the characters come up with a plan for clearing the webs quickly, the party’s travel pace for the day is halved as the characters are forced to cut their way through or find an alternate route.

Check for an encounter, Roll 1d6 On a 1-2 Cave Fishers attack.

#### Crystal Clusters
The adventurers pass through a High Magic interference area containing fist-sized chunks of quartz that shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. A sharp blow to one of the crystals, including throwing it so it impacts a hard surface, causes it to burst in a 10-foot-radius flash of blinding light. Any creature within the radius must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) for 1 minute. A creature [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) by this effect repeats the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded).

#### Fire Storm
Sooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks and ranged attack rolls.

A flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though the originating storm clouds can persist for days, creating multiple flame storms.

#### Collision

This terrain encounter occurs only if one or more party members are traveling by raft or boat, and there’s a strong current. Have the ship DC 13 Dexterity check to avoid hitting a wall or other large obstacle directly ahead. If the group check succeeds, the collision is avoided. Otherwise, the vessel takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage from the collision, and everyone aboard must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling overboard.

#### Rough Current
The waters here are especially turbulent. The boat must make a DC 15 Navigators Check. If the boat fails DC 10 Strength or Dex save to not fall overboard and the boat taked 4d6 bludgeoning damage
#### Necrotic Tempest
Storms infused with the essence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any creature exposed to the storm that isn’t a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6 necrotic damage.

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a [skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17015-skeleton) or [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie) (your choice) 1d10 minutes later.

A necrotic tempest lasts for 1d4 hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for 1d4 days after its passing.
#### Thrym's Howl
These bone-chilling blizzards drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier. The storm projects [extreme cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold "Extreme Cold") (see the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_). Due to the howling wind and dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks made within it have disadvantage.

Any creature exposed to the storm at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can’t regain hit points until it spends at least 1 hour in a warm environment. A creature that dies in the storm freezes solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage are immune to the effects of the storm and can see normally within it.

Thrym’s howl typically lasts 2d10 hours.
#### Horrid Sounds
For hours, the party’s travel is plagued by terrible shrieks, moans, and incoherent gibbering echoing through nearby passages, without any apparent origin. Each character must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character’s madness level increases by 1.
#### Lava Swell
As the party traverses a long and winding corridor, a tremor opens up a lava-filled fissure behind them. Each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the lava swell, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save. The vessel must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid this damage

##### Village of Lugh
Only the roofs of some of the normal houses remain. However a large mead hall sticks out of the ground in the center. Going into the meadhall, they will find skeletons, armored and armed with what are now fairly useless weapons and armor. If any checks are made to investigate, they will find under the throne in the centre is a passage that leads further underground into the tomb of Lugh

On the middle wall the warrior gaining the blessings of two godly figures, A warrior surrounded by a thunder storm and radiating lightning and a woman in the constant motion akin to a fire. Battles against many of foes, terrify monsters, tyranical dragons and horrifing feinds, all starting above the warrior only for him to rise above further down the wall.

The final wall on the right starts the story of with the warrior climbing a mountain but something is off about the warrior, the hero is thinner and smaller as he reaches the top of this mountain, he hands his hammer to a great dragon before descending down the mountain, the dragons face full of sorrow as the warrior charges into battle with a wingless angel bound with chains, The final picture on the wall depicting an empty throne.

#### Flaywind
Supernaturally powerful winds—like those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri—can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.

A flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) or ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature)) check or Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival)) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind typically lasts 1d4 × 10 hours.
