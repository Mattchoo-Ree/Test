One of the largest walls built amoungst the Boarder to [[The Scar]]

While there are other walls that close off larger openings in the harsh mountains surrounding [[The Scar]]. This wall is by far the biggest. It is also home to the best monster hunters in the [[Xi'an]]. Getting plenty of experience from the monsters that attempt to cross the wall.

Most members of the wall, end up training at the safer part of the wall, before leaving and exploring the [[Xi'an]], learning as much as they can about battle, if and when they return and challenge Master Susano, can the officialy join the ranks of the inner gaurd, or roam the eastern boarder of she'an and kill any monsters that slip past the mountains

There are 5 "Sections of the wall"

## The Entrance Ward
The entrance from She'an
Where Training happens
[[Kralzak Ruin]] is the main teacher here. 
The training usualy involves weapon training, then forcing the students to leave on a pligrimiage. where they must fight stronger foes to make them stronger, and develop their own unique style of fighting 
## The Preperation Ward
Where The armor and weapons are created
The armor and weapons made here are stronger then most. Made in the unique style of the [[Xi'an]], and in an way invented pre [[Great Collapse]], making it mor applicable for enchantment, and often develops magic during the battles of the warriors of [[The Wall]] once they are given their weapons and armor
## The Warriors Ward
Where the warriors who protect the Front ward Rest.
Plenty of food, Sake and beds.
## The Front Ward
Where the Strongest warriors patrol and ensure nothing passes. By far the most modern looking part of the wall, thanks to its constant need for repair.
## The Dead mans Ward
The Exit into [[The Scar]]. The battlefield outside the wall, covered in the bones of warriors and monsters alike.
