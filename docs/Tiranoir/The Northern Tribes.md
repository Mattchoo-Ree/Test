The northern tribes produce some of the strongest warriors in the world. Although it is rare that they leave their ancestral land. The northern tribes are hunter gatherers, that organise with eachother to defend agains some of the more pressing threats, like invading monstrosities from [[Cathair Caillte]] and invasions from the [[Xi'an]]. 

The average tribesman is about the power of a level 9 fighter, thanks to the harsh arctic environment and the roaming of large and powerfull monsters like arctic dinosouran like creatures and the various monstrositries and undead that come from [[Tiranoir]]/[[Cathair Caillte]]. Respect is often earned through combat, or through sacrificing for the tribe.
