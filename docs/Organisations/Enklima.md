The Enkilma are a crime family, headed by Leonidas"Leo" Enkilma. They have a hand in smuggling in and out of the isles and have multiple pirate gangs in their pocket. Enklima Himself is a powerful member of Dawnwhic politics and has arguably the most sway in the isles out of everyone on the pirate council and the most strenous relation with the rest of the council members.
[[Leonidas Enklima]]

The main operation of the Enkilma are smuggling, mostly involving illegal substances and artifacts/treasure. Putting them in direct conflict with the Hiketsu.

The Enklima have alot of power amoungst the jade isles, in many of the major settlements they have gaurds and officials on the Enklima pay roll aswell as connections with many pirate gangs


[[Flickering Flame]] Now runs the enklima Being secretley a rakshasa coming into this power, he does like to eat humans but he isn't as evil as many of the rakshasa in the world, instead being almost entirley self focused. If it benifits him he will agree, if it doesn't he wont but he wont go out of his way to do evil things. Although anyone that crosses him and deserves death in his eyes is eaten alive.


With [[Leonidas Enklima]] there is only so much the remaining enklima can do, as other crime organisations from the empirs will start to make their way now that the enklima hold is no longer as strong.


Enklima has three lieutenant

- Tralvem Titantrack- a sea elf
	- Tralvem left his home underwater after escaping a prison their. Tralvem shares a similar greed to enklima and cares not who he has to kill to get more powerfull and rich. Travlem only cares about gaining more power, and would happily take enklima's place. He is still very greedy but is not influenced by one of the arms
	- Tralvem manages the ships and smuggling of goods
- Marak Sarudur - a half orc
	- Marak is a older orc, once a rival of enklima, he decided to join forces with him instead. Marak is a skilled theif but he is not inatley evil, he kills far less then the other two lieutenants and often secretley spends his profits helping the less fortunate, althouhg noone knows about this not being able to aford being seen as weak
	- Marak deals with the more secretive stuff of the organisation, he keeps people hidden and out of jail.
