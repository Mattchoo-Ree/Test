A pirate gang originating from the [[Agrovian Kingdoms]]

The Eucoir are a unique gang of pirates, mainly working with dwarven and halfing individuals aswell as people of similar sizes, this is because of their unique boat design, being much smaller and much faster than alot of boats and well equiped to take down various ships, they are often hired by merchants and protection and will less likley to pirate private shipping companies, unless they are in direct conflict with the Eucoirs continued freedom. 

The Eucoir mostly consist of Ex Agroivian miners and workers that have since left the kingdoms and gone to the furthest place away that they could. Some of them have had bounties placed on their heads by the Agrovian Kingdoms for abandoing their work.


Most of the Members are Gish, using some magic and to enchance their ship fairing. Using spells like mending to help them keep up with cannons damage and gust of wind to increase their ship speed
