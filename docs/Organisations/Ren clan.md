The Ren clan serve the shogunate as one of their most loyal families. Ren came to power due to its head, Ren Ashikawa, having once served the Shogun (insert name here) as their most trusted retainer. After decades of service, the shogun gifted Ashikawa serfs, land, political power, and the Ren family name. 
The Ren clan generates its income exclusively from agriculture, supplying 34% of west [[Xi'an]]'s rice and grain. While the Ren clan has high standings with the shogunate, many rival clans are envious of their quick rise to power. The most antagonistic one being the Genji clan, their political rivalry has resulted in numerous minor conflicts.

**Ren Ashikawa** - father, a strict old man who demands loyalty to the shogunate from his children. He is the daimyo to the Ren clan, but primarily serves as a bureaucrat to the shogunate. 

**Ren Huan** - mother, a gentle lady who once served as a powerful samurai in eastern Shi'An, eventually retiring her sword to settle down with Ashikawa in west Xi'An. While she loves her husband, she does not fully support the Shogunate. She taught Ling how to make his own cosmetics and the basics of combat.
