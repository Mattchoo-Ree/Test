### [[apto]]
Apto is valantar's personal druid, Valantar saved him from a pirate gang. Leonin tribes are extremely rare and the right people would pay alot for one, something valantar does not agree with. Now Apto serves Valantar as a freind, somewhat hounourobound

#### Flagship: Fortunes Night
The flagship of the Hangyaku is specialized to not stand out, with tarps to hide the cannons and the flags of every nation stored on board. The strength of this ship is mostly in the skill of the crew and the ability to get in close and utilise their expert marksmans
