Create a **new github repository using this template**. Click the green button at the top or use [this link](https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs/generate). \n\n![](2021-11-22-22-54-02.png)\n\n2.  **Give a name** to your repository. By default your notes will be published at `\u003chttps://username.github.io/repo-name/\u003e`\n     - Copy only the `main` branch while creating the repo from the template\n3. **Clone** the repository you generated **into your Obsidian folder/vault.**\n4. **Move your notes** that you would like to make public to the `repo-name/docs` folder.\n    - Easiest way to do this would be using drag and drop within Obsidian\n5. Commit and **push** the changes. Github actions will take care of the rest, publishing your notes using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). \n6.

The folders and sub-folders will show up as sections. Try not to have white spaces in your folder and file names, as these will be converted to HTML links. The webpage heading will be the same as the first-level heading in the markdown note.\n\n- If you would like to arrange the pages manually, then use the `nav` option in the `mkdocs.yml` [configuration file](https://www.mkdocs.org/#adding-pages) at the root of this repo  to set custom page navigation.\n    - For example, see the setup for [the Blue Book](https://lyz-code.github.io/blue-book/) at [github](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book/blob/master/mkdocs.yml). Managing each page using `nav` can become cumbersome as the number of notes increase though!\n- The Materials theme provides multiple options to arrange [sections](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#navigation-sections), use [navigation tabs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/#navigation-tabs), and many other helpful [navigation setups](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/)\n\n## Alternatives\n\n- [kmaasrud/oboe](https://github.com/kmaasrud/oboe): tool to convert an Obsidian vault into a static directory of HTML files.\n- [Jackiexiao/foam-mkdocs-template](https://github.com/Jackiexiao/foam-mkdocs-template): template for Obsidian/Foam using mkdocs/mkdocs-material/mkdocs-roamlinks-plugin\n- [foambubble/foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template): Foam workpace template\n- [ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-mkdocs-publisher-template): Obsidian Mkdocs Publisher, a free obsidian publish alternative throught Mkdocs\n\n## Other interesting projects\n\n- [mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden: digital garden with Gatsby](https://github.com/mathieudutour/gatsby-digital-garden)\n- [TuanManhCao/digital-garden: Free Obisidian Publish alternative](https://github.com/TuanManhCao/digital-garden)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T08:15:04.254162072Z","tags":null},"/docs":{"title":"","content":"# Obsidian Notes\n\nPublish your public notes with MkDocs\n\n## Hello World!\n\nThe `index.md` in the `/docs` folder is the homepage you see here.\n\nThe folders in `/docs` appear as the main sections on the navigation bar.\n\nThe notes appear as pages within these sections.

They are known for their proficiency in the art of assassination and their ability to carry out even the most difficult of tasks. Their services are available to anyone who is willing to pay the right price, and their clients range from wealthy nobles and powerful politicians to criminal organizations and demon lords.\n\nThe guild has agents and spies in every corner of the multiverse, and they are always looking for new opportunities to expand their reach and increase their power. They have access to a vast network of portals and teleportation circles that allow them to travel quickly and discreetly from one plane to another.\n\nDespite their ruthless reputation, the Blades of Grim Gates is highly organized and operates with a strict code of ethics. They never break a contract and always keep their word, which has helped them to maintain their reputation and attract new clients. However, they are not above using their considerable skills to further their own interests, and they will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.\n\nThe Blades of Grim Gates is a shadowy and mysterious organization that is rumored to exist in the shadows, and many believe that they have the ability to control the shadows themselves. Despite this, they are always seeking new opportunities to expand their reach and increase their power, and will stop at nothing to achieve their goals.\n\n## Hierarchy:\nThe Blades of Grim Gates is led by a council of powerful individuals, each of whom is an expert in their own field. They are responsible for overseeing the operations of the guild, negotiating contracts, and making strategic decisions. They are also responsible for recruiting new members and training them in the ways of the assassin.\n\n1.  Arcturus Shadowfall: A tiefling rogue who specializes in infiltration and sabotage. He is known for his ability to blend in with any crowd and his cunning mind, which makes him a valuable asset to the guild. He is also a skilled practitioner of the arcane, which allows him to cast spells to aid him in his missions.\n    \n2.  Sable Nightshade: A drow rogue who specializes in poisons and stealth.

They work together to oversee the operations of the guild, negotiate contracts, and make strategic decisions. They are always looking for new opportunities to expand the guild's reach and increase its power, and will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. Although recently Eclipse has gone missing and none in the order have been able to find him\n\n## Headquarters:\n\nThe headquarters of the Blades of the Grim Gates in the Astral Plane is a towering structure that resembles a dark and foreboding fortress. It is surrounded by a sea of silver mist, which makes it nearly impossible to find unless you know exactly where to look. The structure is made of black stone and appears to have been carved from the very fabric of the plane itself.\n\nThe interior of the headquarters is equally as ominous, with dimly lit hallways and rooms that are adorned with strange and exotic artifacts from across the multiverse. The walls are lined with maps and charts that detail the locations of the guild's safehouses, teleportation circles, and the locations of their current contracts.\n\nThe council chamber is located at the heart of the fortress and is where the members of the council meet to discuss their plans and operations. The chamber is a large, circular room with a high, domed ceiling. In the center of the room is a large, circular table surrounded by comfortable chairs, where the council members sit. The walls of the chamber are adorned with intricate tapestries and carvings that depict scenes of assassination and intrigue.\n\nThe headquarters is guarded by powerful wards and is surrounded by powerful demons who are bound to the service of the guild. Access to the headquarters is strictly controlled, and only the most trusted members of the guild are allowed to enter. Those who attempt to breach the fortress without permission are likely to meet a quick and painful end.\n\nThe Blades of the Grim Gates' headquarters in the Astral Plane serves as a symbol of the guild's power and influence, and is a place of great importance to its members. It is here that the council meets to discuss their plans, and it is here that new members are initiated into the guild. It is a place of mystery, power, and danger, and is feared by many throughout the multiverse.\n\n## Resources:\n\n1.  Information Network: The Blades have a vast network of spies and informants that provides them with information about their targets and their movements. This information is used to plan and execute their assassinations with precision.\n    \n2.  Magic and Technology: The guild has access to powerful magic and advanced technology that allows them to carry out their assassinations with efficiency and stealth. They have teleportation circles, invisibility cloaks, and enchanted weapons that can pass through walls and other obstacles.\n    \n3.  Safehouses and Hideouts: The Blades have a network of safehouses and hideouts throughout the multiverse that they use as bases of operations and places to hide if they need to evade pursuit.\n    \n4.  Contacts and Allies: The guild has established alliances with other criminal organizations, powerful individuals, and even governments, which allows them to carry out their operations with impunity. They have access to black markets where they can purchase exotic goods and weapons, and they have smugglers who can help them move contraband across borders.\n    \n5.  Demon Servitors: The Blades have bound powerful demons to their service, which they use as guards and enforcers. These demons are incredibly difficult to defeat and provide the guild with a significant advantage in any confrontation.\n    \n\nOverall, the Blades of the Grim Gates are a highly organized and well-equipped group that has the resources to carry out their operations with deadly efficiency. They are feared by many throughout the multiverse and are respected by those who know of their power and influence.\n\n\n\n## History\nThe Blades of the Grim Gates were formed by a group of skilled assassins who saw the potential for profit in offering their services to those who were willing to pay for them. These assassins came from various backgrounds and had different motivations, but they all shared a desire for power and wealth.\n\nThe founding members of the Blades of the Grim Gates were able to establish their organization by building a network of contacts, acquiring powerful magical artifacts and technologies, and making deals with powerful entities such as demons and other criminal organizations. They began by taking on small, lucrative contracts and using their profits to expand their operations.\n\nOver time, the Blades of the Grim Gates grew in power and influence, becoming one of the most feared and respected organizations in the multiverse. They established their headquarters in the Astral Plane, where they could operate with relative anonymity, and they developed a strict code of conduct that governed the behavior of their members.\n\nThe Blades of the Grim Gates have since become a highly organized and well-equipped group that is feared by many throughout the multiverse. Their influence extends far beyond their headquarters, and they are respected by those who know of their power and efficiency. They are a shadowy force that operates in the shadows, carrying out their operations with deadly efficiency and leaving no trace behind.\n\n## Code of the Grim Gates\n1.  Loyalty: Members of the Blades are expected to be completely loyal to the organization, and to put its interests above their own personal desires or motivations. This ensures that the Blades can operate as a cohesive unit, with all members working together to achieve their common goals.\n    \n2.  Secrecy: The Blades operate in the shadows, and they are expected to maintain the utmost discretion and secrecy at all times. They must avoid drawing attention to themselves and their operations, and they must not reveal any information about the organization or its activities to outsiders.\n    \n3.  Professionalism: Members of the Blades are expected to behave professionally at all times, and to carry out their operations with the utmost skill and efficiency. They must not act impulsively or recklessly, as this could compromise the success of their operations and the safety of the organization.\n    \n4.  Discipline: Members of the Blades must be disciplined and self-controlled, and they must follow the orders of their superiors without question. They must not let their emotions or personal opinions interfere with their duties, and they must remain calm and focused in even the most dangerous or stressful situations.\n    \n5.  Ethics: The Blades operate in a morally ambiguous world, and they must navigate complex ethical dilemmas on a regular basis. However, they are still expected to behave ethically and with integrity, and to avoid actions that could damage the reputation of the organization or put its members in danger.\n\n## Members\n```dataview\nTABLE groups, race, home, occupation, currentLocation, rank\nwhere contains(groups, this.file.link)\n```","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T08:15:04.254162072Z","tags":null},"/docs/Organisations/Bose-Regalier-Trading-Company":{"title":"","content":"Founded and secretly lead by [[Lucien Von Regalier]]\nStarted in a [[Sethayye]] kingdom that became the [[Basturian Empire]]\n\n\u003e[!infobox]\n\u003e #### `=this.file.name`\n\u003e ##### Basic Info\n\u003e **Aliases**\n\u003e Regailier Trading Company\n\u003e **Base of operation**\n\u003e [[Basturian Empire]],[[Aheles]]\n\u003e **Leaders**\n\u003e  [[Lucien Von Regalier|Lucien Von Skontadi]]\n\u003e **Symbol**\n\u003e  A Crossed white flag with a red background and ships in each corner\n\u003e **Favoured Deity**\n\u003e [[Erathis, the Law Bearer]]\n\u003e **Formed**\n\u003e 1967 AG\n\u003e **Member Count**\n\u003e thousands\n\u003e **Relationships**\n\u003e \n\u003e  | Allies | Enemies |\n\u003e  | ------ | ------- |\n\u003e  | [[Basturian Empire]]  |  Other Trading Companies       |\n\n\n## Purpose:\nThe Bose Regalier Trading Company is a highly successful and influential trading organization that operates throughout the land, acquiring and selling goods and services.

Hailing from either the cold climates of Northern [[Council of Mythrenhil|Mythrenhil]] or from a nation made of [[The Outcasted The Lasmuig Dynasty|The Outcasted]], bearfolk put their trust in family and tribe to stand against the world. In defiance of their brutish appearance, they are deeply spiritual and artistic. Their keen senses and physical prowess make them formidable enemies, but their practical nature and protectrive instincts make them fantastic allies. Bearfolk rarley leave their tribes without good reason. Those who do often find themselves pulled into excitement and adventure.\n\n## Tribe and Family\n\nThe core of bearfolk society is the immediate family. Parents care for their cubs until the young reach the age of 5 or 6 years, when a precocious shift takes over. Although they aren’t yet fully grown, the cubs are drawn by a powerful urge to explore. They begin spending time away from their family, treating their entire village (or smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement) as a sort of extended family. This can be surprising or even annoying for nonbearfolk neighbors, who might discover a bearfolk child rooting through their pantry for a snack, inviting itself to dinner, or even adopting them as its new family temporarily. This isn’t necessarily as inconvenient as it sounds, since young bearfolk are also more enthusiastic learners and harder workers around the house than most other children their age.\n\nBeyond immediate family, the tribe forms the majority of bearfolk culture. Once bearfolk cubs start venturing beyond their own homes, families intertwine. Each cares for the cubs that happen by that day, welcoming the wayward children to meal tables as their own. There’s no choice but to know one’s neighbors in a bearfolk tribe, and that brings them all closer together. Trade apprenticeships and budding talents are identified early thanks to this intermingling, and it helps find a suitable niche for a young bearfolk’s path in life.\n\nElders are highly respected for their experience and greater perspective, but practicality carries weight as well. Being old doesn’t afford one unlimited leeway if one makes questionable decisions or has a reputation for foolishness. Building on this respect, bearfolk venerate their ancestors at a nearly demigod level and believe the spirits of their ancestors guide them. The tribe also holds druids and clerics (particularly those that serve nature deities) in high respect and looks to them for guidance.\n## Forgotten Ancestry\n![[1uyt39i9m7b61.webp|right|300]]\nThe true origin of bearfolk is unknown, but many scholars suspect they are the descendants of werebears that took to living in the wilderness. Over time, their lycanthropy became permanent and integral, giving them the best features of human and ursine biology, along with some weaknesses. The best evidence for this is their aversion to silver, which true lycanthropes are known to share. It is not uncommon for bearfolk to take in and mentor those who have been newly cursed with lycanthropy, teaching them how to live with their animal characteristics. It is not possible for bearfolk to pass on their ancestral curse, but the question of whether they can be infected with any new form of lycanthropy is unknown. What is certain is that their origins are not mundane, even though their connection to the natural world is strong.\n\n## Passion and Wrath\n\nTheir intimidating mien is no veneer. Bearfolk have a deep and impressive capacity for violence when roused to anger or in defense of their own. Bearfolk passions run as strong as their bodies, and banter that pushes the boundary into insults and bruised honor often leads to more bruises. Their great physical strength means they excel at battle, and even relatively minor physical altercations can inadvertently become serious. Many bearfolk wear scars from physical contests, both simple competition and more serious matters of wounded honor, that went a little too far.\n\nThanks to their physical prowess, many bearfolk follow the path of the warrior. Barbarians and fighters are common, with rangers and druids following closely.\n\nWhen bearfolk go to war, they do so with the clear goal of protecting their people in the moment and in the future. If that means the destruction of a foe, then so be it. They are adept at weaving their talents together in the same manner they blend families into tribes. Spellcasters favor turning the natural world against their foes with conjured beasts and manipulating battlefield conditions through weather, controlling plants, and even shaping the earth itself.\n\n## Bearfolk Names\n\nBearfolk are given cub names by their parents, similar to names found throughout the Northlands. When a bearfolk comes of age, they earn a new name, either bestowed upon them by an elder or one they choose themselves. This name befits a deed undertaken during their rite of passage into adulthood, describes some honorable or prominent trait of the bearfolk in question, or honors an ancestor.\n\n**Male Names:** Beorst, Cauldvyr, Cirdhan, Dorngal, Erlundt, Gurralt, Hrosvir, Lhod, Nodhr, Yrn\n\n**Female Names:** Anga, Burli, Daegna, Durtta, Farla, Ingyrd, Johanna, Padhra, Sivaer, Tuli\n\n**Deed Names:** Fireheart, Ironhide, Lightblade, Moondancer, Razorclaws, Shadowbane, Stonebones, Valgerdsdottir, Yellowfang, Yrnsson\n## Bearfolk Traits\n![[80edde50f70a8c968c4d126b61871924.jpg|left|300]]\n\nYour bearfolk character has the following racial traits.\n\n_**Creature Type.**_ You are a Humanoid.\n\n_**Size.**_ You are Medium.\n\n_**Speed.**_ Your walking speed is 30 feet.

Roll a d6 at the begining of everyday, on a 1-3 the area only has light magical interference, while on a 4-6 the area has high magical interference.\n\n### Light magical Interference\nWhen a spell of 2nd level or higher or a spell slot of 2nd level or higher is expended for any reason. Roll a d20, on a 15 or above roll on the Unraveling table. Other than that the area is fairly normal. \n\nIf in the underdark roll a d6 again, on a 1-3 the area is dimly lit thanks to mushrooms and lichen otherwise it is darkness.\n\n### High magical interference\nAreas with high magical interference have the following effects\n\n- Areas are always filled with dim light.\n\n-   A creature in an area suffused with faerzress has advantage on saving throws against any divination spells. If a divination spell doesn’t allow a saving throw, the caster must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to cast the spell. Failing this save means the spell is wasted and has no effect.\n\n-   Any creature attempting to teleport into, within, or out of a the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 force damage and the teleportation attempt fails. Even if the save succeeds, the teleportation attempt can suffer a mishap as if the destination was known only by description, regardless of how familiar the destination actually is. See the table in the [teleport](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/teleport) spell for more information.\n\n-   Areas like this have such unstable magic it is activley dangerous to use magic. When a spell of 1st level or higher is cast here, Roll 1d6, On a 1-3 Roll on the unraveling Magic Effects.\n\n### Unraveling Magic Effects\n| d20 | Effect |\n| --- | ------ |\n| 1   |  All magic items in the region temporarily lose their magical properties, becoming nonmagical for 1 hour. Artifacts are unaffected. When the items regain their magic, a creature’s attunement to any of them is restored.      |\n| 2   | The region becomes a dead-magic zone for 1 hour. For the duration, the entire region is affected by the [antimagic field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field) spell.       |\n| 3   | One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be enclosed in [Otiluke’s resilient sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/otilukes-resilient-sphere) for 1 minute.       |\n| 4   |  One random creature in the region that has expended spell slots regains one expended spell slot of a random level.      |\n| 5   |  Flares of magical energy flash through the region for 1 minute. For the duration, each round on initiative count 20 (losing all ties) one random creature in the region takes 2d4 damage of a type determined by a d6: 1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, force; 5, lightning; or 6, thunder.      |\n| 6   |   One of the characters in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a [blink dog](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16809-blink-dog), as if by the [polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/polymorph) spell. The spell lasts for 1 hour or until dispelled.     |\n| 7   |  One random creature in the region that has spell slots expends one spell slot of a random level in a harmless shower of sparks and sounds.      |\n| 8   |   All fire in the region freezes into ice that gives off a blue light equal to the illumination it normally provides. In addition, the region radiates [extreme cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold \"Extreme Cold\") (see the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master’s Guide\")_) for 1 day.     |\n| 9   |   One random creature in the region with spell slots becomes a focal point for ambient magic for 1 hour. At the end of each of the creature’s turns, other creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against the spellcaster’s spell save DC or take 1d6 force damage.     |\n| 10  |   The [flaming sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/flaming-sphere) spell (save DC 15) spontaneously activates in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the party. On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), the sphere moves 30 feet toward the nearest creature. The sphere vanishes after 1 minute.     |\n| 11  |    Simple or martial weapons in the region that are nonmagical crackle with power. For 1 hour, they become magic weapons that grant a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with them.    |\n| 12  |     Swirling energy surrounds one random creature in the region for 24 hours. For the duration, the creature gains resistance to force damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet.   |\n| 13  |  Each character in the region suddenly learns some magic. A character learns one wizard cantrip of the character’s choice and knows the cantrip for 1d8 days.      |\n| 14  |    One random creature in the region crackles with sparks of light for 1 hour. For the duration, the creature magically sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, any creature it touches (requiring an unarmed strike if the target is unwilling) takes 1d6 force damage.    |\n| 15  |  Lightning arcs in a 5-foot wide line between two creatures in the region that are within 30 feet of each other and not behind total cover. Each creature in the line (including the two) must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.      |\n| 16  |   The [reverse gravity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/reverse-gravity) spell (save DC 18) activates for 1 minute, centered on the ground beneath one random creature in the region.     |\n| 17  |  On initiative count 20 (losing all ties), two random creatures in the region must each make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If either save fails, the creatures magically teleport, switching places. If both saves succeed, they don’t teleport.  Catoblepas or Aeorian Reserver    |\n| 18  |One random creature in the region breaks spells for 1 hour. Whenever anyone within 20 feet of the creature casts a spell, the spellcaster must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using its spellcasting ability, or the spell drains away without effect. The spell slot, charge, or feature use that powered the spell is wasted.        |\n| 19  |  During the next 24 hours, the first time a creature in the region targets another creature with a spell, the caster must make a DC 11 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. On a failed save, the spell targets the caster instead. On a successful save, the spell functions normally. This effect then ends.      |\n| 20  | One random creature in the region can suddenly cast the [wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wish) spell once, within the next minute. Reroll if you’ve rolled this effect in the past 24 hours.       |\n\n\n\n### Wild magic surges\n| d100  | effect |\n| ----- | ------ |\n| 1-2   |  Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.      |\n| 3-4   |For the next minute, you can see any [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible) creature if you have line of sight to it.        |\n| 5-6   |  A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later.      |\n| 7-8   | You cast [fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fireball) as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself.       |\n| 9-10  |   You cast [magic missile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-missile) as a 5th-level spell.     |\n| 11-12 | Roll a d10.

A sharp blow to one of the crystals, including throwing it so it impacts a hard surface, causes it to burst in a 10-foot-radius flash of blinding light. Any creature within the radius must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) for 1 minute. A creature [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) by this effect repeats the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded).\n\n#### **Gas Leak**\nThe adventurers come upon a cavern with a dangerous natural gas leak. Any member of the party with a passive Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) score of 14 or higher detects signs of the gas. The characters’ travel pace for the day is slowed by half as they circumvent the area, but there are no ill effects. If the gas goes undetected, each character in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any open flames brought into the area cause the gas to explode. Each creature in the explosion must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n#### Collision\n\nThis terrain encounter occurs only if one or more party members are traveling by raft or boat, and there’s a strong current. Have the ship DC 13 Dexterity check to avoid hitting a wall or other large obstacle directly ahead. If the group check succeeds, the collision is avoided. Otherwise, the vessel takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage from the collision, and everyone aboard must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling overboard.\n\n#### Rockfall\nLoose rocks fall from the ceiling above. 1d10 character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, Disadvantage without light or be hit by a chunk of falling stone for 4d6 bludgeoning damage. All successful saves result in the boat takeing the damage instead, aswell as taking 1d10 extra boulders worth. Charecters can choose to try and catch or be hit by them to stop the boat from takeing damage. \n#### Rough Current\nThe waters here are especially turbulent. The boat must make a DC 15 Navigators Check. If the boat fails DC 10 Strength or Dex save to not fall overboard and the boat taked 4d6 bludgeoning damage\n#### Stone Teeth\nThis terrain encounter occurs only if one or more party members are traveling by raft or boat, and there’s a strong current. Stalagmites jutting up from the bottom of a tunnel are hidden just below the waterline. Spotters must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check to notice the “stone teeth,” allowing the vessel’s crew to attempt a DC 17 Navigaters check to navigate through them. If the check succeeds, the vessel passes through with only half damage. Failure to notice or navigate through the stone teeth deals 6d6 piercing damage to the boat or raft.\n#### Whirlpool\nAn underwater crevasse or drain creates a small vortex in this area, When the boat enters this area, it must make a DC 17 Navigators Check to get around it\n#### Horrid Sounds\nFor hours, the party’s travel is plagued by terrible shrieks, moans, and incoherent gibbering echoing through nearby passages, without any apparent origin. Each character must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character’s madness level increases by 1.\n#### Lava Swell\nAs the party traverses a long and winding corridor, a tremor opens up a lava-filled fissure behind them. Each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the lava swell, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save. The vessel must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid this damage\n#### Ruins\n#### Steam Vent\nA hot steam vent erupts beneath a random party member, who must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (2d6) fire damage.\n#### Webs\nSticky webs fills a passage (see “[Dungeon Hazards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#DungeonHazards)” in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). The webs extend for hundreds of feet. Unless the characters come up with a plan for clearing the webs quickly, the party’s travel pace for the day is halved as the characters are forced to cut their way through or find an alternate route.\n\nCheck for an encounter, Roll 1d6 On a 1-2 Cave Fishers attack.\n\n\n### Overland Environments\n| d10 | Environment     |\n| --- | --------------- |\n| 1   | Crystal Cluster |\n| 2   | Fire Storm       |\n| 3   | Collision       |\n| 4   | Rough Current   |\n| 5   | Necrotic Tempest|\n| 6   | Thrym's Howl       |\n| 7   | Horrid Sounds   |\n| 8   | Lava Swell      |\n| 9   | Ruins           |\n| 10  | Flaywind   | \n#### Crystal Clusters\nThe adventurers pass through a High Magic interference area containing fist-sized chunks of quartz that shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. A sharp blow to one of the crystals, including throwing it so it impacts a hard surface, causes it to burst in a 10-foot-radius flash of blinding light. Any creature within the radius must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) for 1 minute. A creature [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) by this effect repeats the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded).\n\n#### Fire Storm\nSooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes 2d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks and ranged attack rolls.\n\nA flame storm usually lasts 2d4 minutes, though the originating storm clouds can persist for days, creating multiple flame storms.\n\n#### Collision\n\nThis terrain encounter occurs only if one or more party members are traveling by raft or boat, and there’s a strong current. Have the ship DC 13 Dexterity check to avoid hitting a wall or other large obstacle directly ahead. If the group check succeeds, the collision is avoided. Otherwise, the vessel takes 5d10 bludgeoning damage from the collision, and everyone aboard must succeed on a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling overboard.\n\n#### Rough Current\nThe waters here are especially turbulent.

Any creature exposed to the storm that isn’t a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take 3d6 necrotic damage.\n\nA creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a [skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17015-skeleton) or [zombie](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17077-zombie) (your choice) 1d10 minutes later.\n\nA necrotic tempest lasts for 1d4 hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for 1d4 days after its passing.\n#### Thrym's Howl\nThese bone-chilling blizzards drive a wall of wind and snow like a living glacier. The storm projects [extreme cold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#ExtremeCold \"Extreme Cold\") (see the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg \"Dungeon Master’s Guide\")_). Due to the howling wind and dense blue-white ice particles, the area in the storm is heavily obscured, and ranged attack rolls and Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) checks made within it have disadvantage.\n\nAny creature exposed to the storm at the start of its turn takes 2d6 cold damage and can’t regain hit points until it spends at least 1 hour in a warm environment. A creature that dies in the storm freezes solid. Creatures that are immune to cold damage are immune to the effects of the storm and can see normally within it.\n\nThrym’s howl typically lasts 2d10 hours.\n#### Horrid Sounds\nFor hours, the party’s travel is plagued by terrible shrieks, moans, and incoherent gibbering echoing through nearby passages, without any apparent origin. Each character must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character’s madness level increases by 1.\n#### Lava Swell\nAs the party traverses a long and winding corridor, a tremor opens up a lava-filled fissure behind them. Each character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the lava swell, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save. The vessel must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to avoid this damage\n#### Ruins\nRuins\n\n|  d   |   Ruin             |\n| --- | -------------- |\n| 1   | Village of Lug | \n\n##### Village of Lugh\nOnly the roofs of some of the normal houses remain. However a large mead hall sticks out of the ground in the center. Going into the meadhall, they will find skeletons, armored and armed with what are now fairly useless weapons and armor. If any checks are made to investigate, they will find under the throne in the centre is a passage that leads further underground into the tomb of Lugh\n**See Tomb of Lugh in Book**\nThe final room depicts the story of \"Lugh\". With a heroic statue of a man wearing the mask of the change bringer and wielding a hammer addorned with imagery of Kord and wearing a Regal set of armor similar to that wich you could find earlier in the ruins. The walls a stone mural carved, depicting the mans life.\nThe left most wall depicts a warrior, training, exploring and rising to great challenges. \n\nOn the middle wall the warrior gaining the blessings of two godly figures, A warrior surrounded by a thunder storm and radiating lightning and a woman in the constant motion akin to a fire. Battles against many of foes, terrify monsters, tyranical dragons and horrifing feinds, all starting above the warrior only for him to rise above further down the wall.\n\nThe final wall on the right starts the story of with the warrior climbing a mountain but something is off about the warrior, the hero is thinner and smaller as he reaches the top of this mountain, he hands his hammer to a great dragon before descending down the mountain, the dragons face full of sorrow as the warrior charges into battle with a wingless angel bound with chains, The final picture on the wall depicting an empty throne.\n\n#### Flaywind\nSupernaturally powerful winds—like those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri—can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.\n\nA flaywind leaves 4d6 feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Arcana)) or ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Nature)) check or Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Survival)) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind typically lasts 1d4 × 10 hours.\n\n\n### Creature Encounters\n| d20 | Encounter                                                                              |     |\n| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |\n| 1   | [[Scar Drifter]]                                                                       | 1   |\n| 2   | [Asteroid spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2506147-asteroid-spider)          | 0   |\n| 3   | [Gray Render](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560836-gray-render)                  | 0   |\n| 4   | [Nightmare Beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2506156-nightmare-beast)          | 1   |\n| 5   | [Neothelid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560887-neothelid)                      | 0   |\n| 6   | [Cave Fisher](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560751-cave-fisher) (Underdark Only) | 0   |\n| 7   | [Catoblepas](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560750-catoblepas) (Surface Only)     | 0   |\n| 8   | [Shoosuva](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560914-shoosuva)                        | 0   |\n| 9   | AeorIan Reserver                                                                       | 0   |\n| 10  | Aeorian Absorber                                                                       | 0   |\n| 11  | Aeorian Nullifier                                                                      | 0   |\n| 12  | [[Soul Hound - Todo]]                                                                   | 0   |\n| 13  | [[Astral Hunter - Todo]]                                                               | 0   |\n| 14  | [[Alukah - Todo]] Radiant Vuln                                                                      | 0   |\n| 15  | [Gaj](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2821166-gaj) but with fire vuln                                 | 0   |\n| 16  | [Megapede](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2821180-megapede)                        | 0   |\n| 17  | [Neh- Thalggu](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2821183-neh-thalggu)  Fire vuln               | 0   |\n| 18  | [Void Scaver](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2821211-void-scavver)                 | 0   |\n| 18  | [Alyxian Aboleth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2407522-alyxian-aboleth) Lave based(Cold Vuln)         | 1   |\n| 20  | [Cosmic Horror](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2821160-cosmic-horror)              | 0   | \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-08T08:15:04.258162154Z","tags":null},"/docs/Tiranoir/Tiranoir":{"title":"","content":"A mostly Unexplored Land Mass, Very few ships make it to the Newly discovered continent and even fewer return.
