Hailing from either the cold climates of Northern [[Council of Mythrenhil|Mythrenhil]] or from a nation made of [[The Outcasted The Lasmuig Dynasty|The Outcasted]], bearfolk put their trust in family and tribe to stand against the world. In defiance of their brutish appearance, they are deeply spiritual and artistic. Their keen senses and physical prowess make them formidable enemies, but their practical nature and protectrive instincts make them fantastic allies. Bearfolk rarley leave their tribes without good reason. Those who do often find themselves pulled into excitement and adventure.</p>"},{"location":"Races/BearFolk/#tribe-and-family","title":"Tribe and Family","text":"<p>The core of bearfolk society is the immediate family. Parents care for their cubs until the young reach the age of 5 or 6 years, when a precocious shift takes over. Although they aren\u2019t yet fully grown, the cubs are drawn by a powerful urge to explore. They begin spending time away from their family, treating their entire village (or smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement) as a sort of extended family. This can be surprising or even annoying for nonbearfolk neighbors, who might discover a bearfolk child rooting through their pantry for a snack, inviting itself to dinner, or even adopting them as its new family temporarily. This isn\u2019t necessarily as inconvenient as it sounds, since young bearfolk are also more enthusiastic learners and harder workers around the house than most other children their age.</p> <p>Beyond immediate family, the tribe forms the majority of bearfolk culture. Once bearfolk cubs start venturing beyond their own homes, families intertwine. Each cares for the cubs that happen by that day, welcoming the wayward children to meal tables as their own. There\u2019s no choice but to know one\u2019s neighbors in a bearfolk tribe, and that brings them all closer together. Trade apprenticeships and budding talents are identified early thanks to this intermingling, and it helps find a suitable niche for a young bearfolk\u2019s path in life.</p> <p>Elders are highly respected for their experience and greater perspective, but practicality carries weight as well. Being old doesn\u2019t afford one unlimited leeway if one makes questionable decisions or has a reputation for foolishness. Building on this respect, bearfolk venerate their ancestors at a nearly demigod level and believe the spirits of their ancestors guide them. The tribe also holds druids and clerics (particularly those that serve nature deities) in high respect and looks to them for guidance.</p>"},{"location":"Races/BearFolk/#forgotten-ancestry","title":"Forgotten Ancestry","text":"<p>![[1uyt39i9m7b61.webp|right|300]] The true origin of bearfolk is unknown, but many scholars suspect they are the descendants of werebears that took to living in the wilderness. Over time, their lycanthropy became permanent and integral, giving them the best features of human and ursine biology, along with some weaknesses. The best evidence for this is their aversion to silver, which true lycanthropes are known to share. It is not uncommon for bearfolk to take in and mentor those who have been newly cursed with lycanthropy, teaching them how to live with their animal characteristics. It is not possible for bearfolk to pass on their ancestral curse, but the question of whether they can be infected with any new form of lycanthropy is unknown. What is certain is that their origins are not mundane, even though their connection to the natural world is strong.</p>"},{"location":"Races/BearFolk/#passion-and-wrath","title":"Passion and Wrath","text":"<p>Their intimidating mien is no veneer. Bearfolk have a deep and impressive capacity for violence when roused to anger or in defense of their own. Bearfolk passions run as strong as their bodies, and banter that pushes the boundary into insults and bruised honor often leads to more bruises. Their great physical strength means they excel at battle, and even relatively minor physical altercations can inadvertently become serious. Many bearfolk wear scars from physical contests, both simple competition and more serious matters of wounded honor, that went a little too far.</p> <p>Thanks to their physical prowess, many bearfolk follow the path of the warrior. Barbarians and fighters are common, with rangers and druids following closely.</p> <p>When bearfolk go to war, they do so with the clear goal of protecting their people in the moment and in the future. If that means the destruction of a foe, then so be it. They are adept at weaving their talents together in the same manner they blend families into tribes.
